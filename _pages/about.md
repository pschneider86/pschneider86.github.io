    <p>Hi, my name is Patrick! I'm a Cloud Solutions Architect by day, coffee nerd by choice, and part-time firefighter when duty calls. <br /><br /> 
    
    My cloud journey kicked off in 2022 when I helped migrate the Mercedes-Benz intranet to AWS â€” and letâ€™s just say, Iâ€™ve been happily tangled in IAM policies and organizational units ever since.</p>
</div>

What I love about the cloud? Itâ€™s fast-moving, ever-changing, and just the right amount of chaotic. Thereâ€™s always something new to learn (and occasionally unlearn). I specialized in AWS IAM and Organizations so far, but I enjoy exploring all kinds of cloud challengesâ€”mainly because Iâ€™m curious, and maybe just a bit stubborn.

This blog is where I share tutorials, tips, and tech adventuresâ€”always in a down-to-earth, no-buzzword style. In future you may also find the occasional post about soccer (Auf die Blaue! ðŸ’™), a story or two from the fire department, or a strong opinion on espresso.

Wanna chat in real life? Hit me up for a beer at the Gazi-Stadion during home games of the Stuttgarter Kickers!
